Description: Interactive data visualization for data practitioners. 'flourishcharts' allows users to visualize their data 
  using 'Flourish' graphs that are grounded in data storytelling principles. Users can create racing bar & line
  charts, as well as other interactive elements commonly found in 'D3' graphics, easily in 'R' and 'Python'. 
  The package relies on an enterprise API provided by 'Flourish', a data visualization platform <https://developers.flourish.studio/api/introduction/>.
